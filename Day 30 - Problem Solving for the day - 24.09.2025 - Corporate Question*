//You are at an auto stand where the fare depends on the distance you travel. Write a program that calculates the auto fare based on the distance entered by the user.
1.If the distance is less than or equal to 2 km, the fare is ₹30 (minimum charge).
2.If the distance is more than 2 km and up to 5 km, the fare is ₹50.
3.If the distance is more than 5 km and up to 10 km, the fare is ₹80.
4.If the distance is more than 10 km, the fare is ₹100 + ₹10 for every km beyond 10 km.
*Test Case 1* 
Input : Distance = 3
Output : Fare: ₹50
*Test Case 2* 
Input : Distance = 12
Output : Fare 120
