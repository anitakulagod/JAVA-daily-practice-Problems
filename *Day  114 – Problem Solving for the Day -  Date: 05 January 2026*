//Andy wants to go on a vacation to de-stress himself. He plans to take one continuous trip to an island.There are N consecutive days, numbered from 1 to N.
Andy already has M obligations, each scheduled on a specific day Di.If Andy has an obligation on a day, he cannot take vacation on that day unless he cancels it.
Andy is allowed to cancel at most K obligations.Your task is to determine the maximum number of consecutive days Andy can take vacation by canceling at most K obligations.
Input Format
-The first line contains an integer N — total number of days
-The second line contains an integer M — total number of obligations
-The third line contains an integer K — maximum obligations that can be canceled
-The next M lines each contain an integer Di, representing a day with an obligation
Output Format
Print a single integer representing the maximum consecutive vacation days
