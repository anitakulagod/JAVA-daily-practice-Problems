//A company wants to calculate a bonus for employees based on their performance rating.
*Write a Java program that:*
1.Takes employee’s base salary and performance rating (Excellent, Good, Average, Poor) as input.
2.Uses if-else if statements to calculate the adjusted salary and bonus:
   - Excellent → 20% increase and ₹10,000 bonus
   - Good → 10% increase and ₹5,000 bonus
   - Average → 5% increase and ₹2,000 bonus
   - Poor → No increase, no bonus
3.Prints the final salary and bonus.
Input:
 - Base salary (double)
 - Performance rating (String)
Output:
 - Adjusted salary
 - Bonus
*Test Case :*
Input:
Base Salary: 50000
Performance Rating: Excellent
Output :
Adjusted Salary: 60000
Bonus: 10000

import java.util.Scanner;

public class EmployeeBonusCalculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter Base Salary: ");
        double baseSalary = sc.nextDouble();
        sc.nextLine(); // consume newline

        System.out.print("Enter Performance Rating (Excellent/Good/Average/Poor): ");
        String rating = sc.nextLine();

        double adjustedSalary = baseSalary;
        int bonus = 0;

        if (rating.equalsIgnoreCase("Excellent")) {
            adjustedSalary = baseSalary + (baseSalary * 0.20);
            bonus = 10000;
        }
        else if (rating.equalsIgnoreCase("Good")) {
            adjustedSalary = baseSalary + (baseSalary * 0.10);
            bonus = 5000;
        }
        else if (rating.equalsIgnoreCase("Average")) {
            adjustedSalary = baseSalary + (baseSalary * 0.05);
            bonus = 2000;
        }
        else if (rating.equalsIgnoreCase("Poor")) {
            adjustedSalary = baseSalary;
            bonus = 0;
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("Invalid Performance Rating!");
            sc.close();
            return;
        }

        System.out.println("Adjusted Salary: " + (int)adjustedSalary);
        System.out.println("Bonus: " + bonus);

        sc.close();
