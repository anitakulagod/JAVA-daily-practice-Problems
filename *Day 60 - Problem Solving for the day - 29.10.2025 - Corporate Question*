//Write a Java program to print the sum of all even numbers and odd numbers separately between 1 and 50.Use a loop (for or while) to iterate through numbers from 1 to 50.
*Calculate:*
A.The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 50.
B.The sum of all odd numbers between 1 and 50.
C.Print both sums clearly in the output.
*Output :*
Sum of even numbers between 1 and 50: 650
Sum of odd numbers between 1 and 50: 625

public class SumEvenOdd {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int evenSum = 0;
        int oddSum = 0;

        // Loop from 1 to 50
        for (int i = 1; i <= 50; i++) {

            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                evenSum += i;

                oddSum += i;
