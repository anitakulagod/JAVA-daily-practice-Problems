//You are working as a software engineer in the HR department of a company. The HR system maintains a list of employee IDs in the order in which employees joined the company
The HR manager wants a program to check if a specific employee ID exists in the system and, if it does, return its position in the list. If the ID does not exist, the program should indicate that the employee is not found.
Since the employee list is unsorted, you need to use a linear search to find the ID.
Input:
An array of integers employeeIDs[] representing employee IDs in the order they joined.
An integer targetID representing the employee ID to search for.
Output:
If targetID exists, print:
"Employee ID targetID found at position X" (position starts from 0).
If targetID does not exist, print:
"Employee ID targetID not found"
*Test Case :*
Input:
employeeIDs = [101, 205, 309, 402, 150]
targetID = 500
Output:
Employee ID 500 not found

import java.util.Scanner;

public class EmployeeSearch {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter number of employees: ");
        int n = sc.nextInt();

        int[] employeeIDs = new int[n];

        System.out.println("Enter employee IDs:");
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            employeeIDs[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }

        System.out.print("Enter target employee ID to search: ");
        int targetID = sc.nextInt();

        boolean found = false;

        // Linear Search
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (employeeIDs[i] == targetID) {
                System.out.println("Employee ID " + targetID + " found at position " + i);
                found = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (!found) {
            System.out.println("Employee ID " + targetID + " not found");
        }

        sc.close();
    }
}
