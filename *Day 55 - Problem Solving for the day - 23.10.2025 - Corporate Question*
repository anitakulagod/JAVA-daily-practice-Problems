//Write a Java program to count the number of occurrences of a specific character in a given string.
//1.The program should take a string and a character as input.
//2.The comparison should be case-sensitive (i.e., 'A' and 'a' are different).
//3.Display the total number of times the character appears in the string.
//*Test Case :*
//Input : "programming"  
//Character: 'm'
//Output : Number of occurrences of 'm': 2

import java.util.Scanner;

public class CountCharacterOccurrences {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Input string
        System.out.print("Enter a string: ");
        String str = sc.nextLine();

        // Input character
        System.out.print("Enter a character to count: ");
        char ch = sc.next().charAt(0);

        int count = 0;

        // Count occurrences
        for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
            if (str.charAt(i) == ch) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        // Output
        System.out.println("Number of occurrences of '" + ch + "': " + count);

        sc.close();
