//A cloud operations team monitors minute-by-minute net changes in server load to ensure system stability.
1.A positive value means the server load increased during that minute.
2.A negative value means the load reduced due to task completion or scaling.
To investigate performance issues, the team wants to identify the continuous time period during which the total load increase was the highest, so they can analyze what caused the spike.
Given an integer array arr of size N representing net server load changes per minute, find the maximum cumulative load increase over any continuous time interval.
At least one minute must be included in the analysis.
*Test Case 01 :*
Input :
N = 9
arr = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
Output : 6
*Test Case 02 :*
Input :
N = 5
arr = [-4, -2, -7, -1, -3]
Output : -1
*Test Case 03 :*
Input :
N = 6
arr = [3, -2, 5, -1, 6, -3]
Output : 11
