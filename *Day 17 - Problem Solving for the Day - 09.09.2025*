//In the Electricity Board, the billing system needs to decide if a customer is eligible for a subsidy on electricity bill.
//*A customer gets Subsidy if:*
//1.The customer is from a Rural Area AND
//2.The customer’s electricity usage is below 100 units
//*Additionally:*
//If the customer is from an Urban Area OR usage is above 500 units, then they must pay an extra surcharge.
//*Write a Java program using logical operators (&&, ||, !) to determine:*
//1.Whether the customer gets a subsidy
//2.Whether the customer needs to pay a surcharge
//*Test Case 01 :*
//Input :
//Area: Rural
//Units: 80
//Output :
//Customer is eligible for Subsidy.
//No Surcharge.
//*Test Case 02 :*
//Input:
//Area: Urban
//Units: 120
//Output :
//Customer is NOT eligible for Subsidy.
//Customer has to pay SURCHARGE.
