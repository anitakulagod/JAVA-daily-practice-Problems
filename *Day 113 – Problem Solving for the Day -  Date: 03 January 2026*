//Two friends, Alex and Ben, are analyzing a player’s points scored in consecutive matches.They want to see if the player’s performance can be arranged in ascending order to identify improvement patterns.
1.The scores are recorded in an integer array arr of size N.
2.Alex notices that the scores are almost in order, but maybe just one mix-up happened.
3.Ben suggests that if they swap just two scores, they might get the perfect ascending sequence.
4.Your task is to determine whether it is possible to have the scores in perfect ascending order by swapping only one pair.
5.This helps the friends quickly analyze performance trends without reviewing all games manually.
*Test Case 01 :*
Input :
N = 5
arr = [10, 20, 15, 25, 30]
Output : Yes
*Test Case 02 :*
Input :
N = 6
arr = [12, 18, 25, 20, 15, 30]
Output : No 
*Test Case 03 :*
Input :
N = 4
arr = [8, 5, 10, 12]
Output :Yes
