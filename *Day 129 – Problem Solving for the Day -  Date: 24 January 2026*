//A logistics company named FastMove operates a smart warehouse that packs products into shipping boxes every hour. During each hour, a fixed number of products arrive at the warehouse, and every product has a specific weight while each box has a maximum weight capacity. The packing system loads the products one by one in the order they arrive and keeps adding them into the current box until the weight limit is reached. Once the box reaches its maximum capacity, it is sealed and sent for delivery, and a new box is opened for the remaining products. Any extra weight beyond the allowed capacity is not permitted in a box. If a single product’s weight is greater than the box capacity, it must be shipped alone using a special box. The company wants to simulate this packing process to plan how many delivery trucks will be needed. Your task is to calculate how many boxes are required to pack all the products based on their weights and the box capacity.
Input Format
N → Number of products
W → Maximum weight capacity of one box
arr[] → Array representing weights of N products in arrival order
Output
Return the minimum number of boxes required to pack all products.
*Test Case 1 :*
Input :
N = 6  
W = 10  
arr = [2, 4, 6, 3, 5, 2]
Output : 3
*Test Case 02 :*
Input :
N = 4  
W = 5  
arr = [6, 2, 3, 4]
Output : 3
*Test Case 03 :*
Input :
N = 5  
W = 8  
arr = [1, 3, 4, 2, 6]
Output : 2
