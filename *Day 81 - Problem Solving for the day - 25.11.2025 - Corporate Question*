//A company is building a typo-detection feature for a chat application. To detect minor typos, the system must check whether two words differ by exactly one character.
You are given two strings S1 and S2. Your task is to determine whether the words differ by exactly one character, meaning:
*Conditions:*
1.Both strings must be of equal length
2.The number of differing positions must be exactly 1
3.All other characters must match
4.Print "YES" if they differ by exactly one character, otherwise print "NO".
*Test Case 01 :*
Input:
S1 = "coding"
S2 = "coring"
Output: YES
*Test Case 02 :*
Input:
S1 = "error"
S2 = "errors"
Output: NO
*Test Case 03 :*
Input:
S1 = ""
S2 = ""
Output: NO
*Test Case 04 :*
Input:
S1 = "x"
S2 = "x"
Output: NO
